File structure:
    src/ contains the source files
    object/ contains the compiled object files
    bin/ contains the linked executable files
    includes/ contains the included header files and other files. (all contents of these directory are needed to successfully compile and run the application)
    resources/ contains the input data used to test the algorithm
    result/ contains the results of the assignment
    
   
Running and compiling the code:
    to compile use: 
		make
    to run the code use:
		make run  (to run using a default file)
		./bin/pca resources/rainfall.dat to run using the data presented for the assignment
		./bin/pca <filename> in general to run with a specific file with data of 2-D data

The file report.pdf has the answers for the assignment and the file in results directory is where these answers where taken from.

This library used to calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvector is Eigen and the data for it is included in the includes directory.
Thank you!!!!
